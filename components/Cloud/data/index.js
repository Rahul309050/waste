    title: "What is Wire Transfer Fraud?",
    description:
      "Wire transfer fraud occurs when a manual bank transfer occurs to transfer funds between entities. Attackers compromise an organisation’s email system and use their unauthorised access to start looking for finance and payment-related employees. Our Incident Response team sees attackers lurk in the email for months waiting for a payment to compromise. Then the two entities exchange emails with payment info, they will insert a second email making it seem like there was a transcription error and please use the new account number (or take the exchanged credentials and attack the bank account directly). They then divert the transferred money out of the fake destination before anyone notices. There are other flavours of this type of attack as well.",

      "Ransomware is malicious software (malware) that encrypts data and critical system files, rendering computers and data unusable without decryption. Decryption is only possible with a key that is only provided if a ransom is paid to the attacker. These ransoms are paid using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and range from hundreds to millions of dollars in value. The attacks have gotten quite sophisticated in their methods for attacking, gaining unauthorized access, and infecting organizations (while attacks against home users are down, targeted attacks against companies and municipalities are sharply increasing) have evolved to include sophisticated and difficult to discern emails (phishing) or using other malware to spread their ransomware payloads.",

The use of automated mechanisms (such as an intrusion detection system or an intrusion prevention system for network security) to aid the perpetually overworked and understaffed IT team is essential, and appropriately tuned alerting is one of the primary goals of the information security program because any Internet-connected environment is under constant attack. Detecting only those attacks with a chance of being successful is essential.",

Educating the people who must respond when an emergency occurs (and their backups in the event they are unavailable) is the next task. Finally, and perhaps most important, is testing that plan regularly (and learning from and addressing the results of those tests).

Malicious emails account for nearly three-quarters of security breaches or attacks. It’s often a good idea to pass around screenshots of any phishing emails that have been received by staff to make sure everyone is aware of them and can more easily identify any future suspicious emails.",

      "When working away from the office you shouldn’t use internet cafes, public Wi-Fi or shared computers when accessing sensitive or restricted information. If possible, it’s best not to use personal laptops or home computers for this type of work. It’s better to use a company laptop with all the necessary security controls installed. It’s good practice to make sure that restricted information is password protected and that laptop hard drives and memory devices are encrypted. When working remotely it’s important to connect to the office network using a secure connection, especially in public areas using a wireless connection. Remote workers can be vulnerable to scams and data breaches. It is important that every company includes cyber security considerations in their remote working policy. For example: Do employees use company laptops and phones? What access do they have to sensitive data? Do they know who to contact regarding any cyber security issues or concerns?",
