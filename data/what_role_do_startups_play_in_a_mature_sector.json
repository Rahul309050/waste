It is still possible for a smaller company to carve out a niche for itself, even if there are bigger fish in the pond In fact, SMEs are quite beneficial for the customer as they would be the only organizations willing to innovate and come up with better solutions. Here are a few ways we have found that SMEs can survive and even thrive in an established sector:",

The only choice they have is in how they choose to allocate those resources (whether it be workers, computing power etc.). And when it comes to Multi National Companies, they would rather focus on the customers that provide the most return for their work. This ends up being other MNCs or other large organisations. ANd because of this, the average business man gets sidelined as he just isn't as profitable. This leaves a huge opening for SMEs to fill the gap, and provide small and mid sized companies their services."

SMEs, by their definition, are more able to focus on their customers and provide more personalised solutions. This is something many businesses appreciate."

Monopolies tend to get so comfortable at the top that they stop seeing the value in Research and Development, which does not have a clear monetary return in the short run. Due to this, they stop innovating and start raising prices as they virtually have no other competition to keep them in check. Ultimately, this is very bad for the end customer, and that is why start-Ups and SMEs are crucial to keep prices down and industries innovating."
